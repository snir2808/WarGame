 # War Game

Hi my name is Snir.
I'm here to explain to you about the project you're about to see.
I built a "war" card game
Game Instructions:
Distribute a deck of cards in half to each player.
In each turn each player draws a card from his deck and displays it on the table.
The player with the larger card wins the round.
If both players draw the same card then there is a "war" and the fun begins :)
Wish you a pleasant use :)
